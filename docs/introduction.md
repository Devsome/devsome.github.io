title: Introduction

Hello! I am a documentary, may not be perfect but was built with love.
I will show you how to set up the project, work on it and find your way around.

A free and open-source project for the MMORPG Silkroad Online. Feel free to create issues or contribute to that project. If you have any questions, just ask!

This is how the start page of the project looks like.
